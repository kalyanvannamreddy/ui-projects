          Many geographers are tarined in toponymy and cartology. this is not thier main proceupation. Geographies study the space and the temprol database distribution of phenomena,
          process, and features as well as the interaction of humans and their environment.Because space and place affect a varity of topics.
          Such as economics, health, climate plants and animals ,geography is highly interdisciplinary. The interdisciplinary nature of the geographical approach 
          depends on an attentiveness to the relationship between physical and human phenomena and its spatial patterns.</br></br>
          <h4>
            <b>Integrated Geographic</b>
          </h4>
          geography as a discipline can be split broadly inton two main subsidiary fields
          human geography and physical geography. I he tormer largely focuses on the built environment and how humans create view, manage, and influence
          space. The latter rxamines the natural environment and how organisms, climate, soil, water and landforms produce and interact.</br></br></br>
          the difference between these approaches led to a third field, environmental 
          geography. Which combines physical and human geography and concerns the interactions between the environment and humans.</br></br></br>
          The accompany text mentions seven outer regions beyond the ensircling ocean. The descriptions of five of them have survived. In 
          contrast to the image Mundi, an earlier Babylonian world map dating back to the 9th century
          BC depicted Babylonian as being further north from the center of the world, though it is not certain what that center ws supposed to represent.

            The oldest known world maps date back to ancient Babylon from the 9th century BC. The best known Babylonian world map, however, is the Imago Mundi of 600 BC. The map as reconstructed by Eckhard Unger shows Babylon on the Euphrates, surrounded by a circular landmass showing Assyria, Urartu and several cities, in turn surrounded by a "bitter river" (Oceanus), with seven islands arranged around it so as to form a seven-pointed star.</br></br>

            The ideas of Anaximander: considered by later Greek writers to be the true founder of geography, come to us through fragments quoted by his successors. Anaximander is credited with the invention of the gnomon, the simple, yet efficient Greek instrument that allowed the early measurement of latitude. Thales is also credited with the prediction of eclipses. The foundations of geography can be traced to the ancient cultures, such as the ancient, medieval, and early modern Chinese.</br></br>

            Names of places... are not geography... know by heart a whole gazetteer full of them would not, in itself, constitute anyone a geographer. Geography has higher aims than this: it seeks to classify phenomena.

            The Greeks, who were the first to explore geography as both art and science, achieved this through Cartography, Philosophy, and Literature, or through Mathematics. There is some debate about who was the first person to assert that the Earth is spherical in shape, with the credit going either to Parmenides or Pythagoras. Anaxagoras was able to demonstrate that the profile of the Earth was circular by explaining eclipses. However, he still believed that the Earth was a flat disk, as did many of his contemporaries.</br></br>
            The first rigorous system of latitude and longitude lines is credited to Hipparchus. He employed a sexagesimal system that was derived from Babylonian mathematics.
